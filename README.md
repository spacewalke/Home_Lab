# üñ•Ô∏è Proxmox VE Home Lab ‚Äî Virtualization & System Administration  
**Hardware:** ZimaBlade ‚Ä¢ 1TB SSD ‚Ä¢ DDR3L RAM  

---

## üìå Project Overview  
I‚Äôve been building a self-hosted virtualization lab on a **ZimaBlade mini-server** using **Proxmox VE**.  
The aim is to have a compact, efficient platform for running multiple VMs and containers, experimenting with services, and honing my sysadmin and security skills ‚Äî all within my own network.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Build  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Setup**  
- Installed the **1TB SSD** and **DDR3L RAM** into the ZimaBlade  
- Hooked up power, Ethernet, keyboard, mouse, and monitor  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Proxmox VE**  
- Downloaded the latest **Proxmox VE ISO** from the [official site](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads)  
- Flashed the ISO to a USB stick (**Rufus** on Windows / **Balena Etcher** on Mac/Linux)  
- Booted from USB and installed Proxmox VE to the SSD  
- Set **root password**, hostname, timezone, and network configuration  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Web Interface Access**  
- Opened `https://<server-ip>:8006` in a browser  
- Logged in with **root** credentials set during installation  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Virtual Machines & Containers**  
- Uploaded OS ISOs (**Ubuntu Server**, **Debian**, **Kali Linux**) to Proxmox storage  
- Created **VMs** with dedicated CPU, RAM, and disk allocations  
- Spun up **LXC containers** for lightweight, service-based workloads  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying Services**  
- **Docker + Portainer** ‚Üí Simplified app deployment & management  
- **Pi-hole** ‚Üí Network-wide ad blocking  
- **Nextcloud / Samba** ‚Üí File server for personal and shared storage  

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Backup & Snapshot Management**  
- Took **snapshots** before making major changes  
- Scheduled **automated backups** to both local storage and external drives  

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Security Hardening**  
- Enabled **2FA** for Proxmox login  
- Configured **firewall rules** to limit access  
- Set up **SSH key authentication** for secure remote management

## üí° Future Lab Experiments  
- SOC environment with **Security Onion**  
- Honeypots (**Cowrie**, **Dionaea**) for hands-on threat analysis  
- VLAN & network segmentation testing  
- **ELK stack** for log collection, aggregation, and monitoring
