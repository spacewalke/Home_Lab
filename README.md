üñ•Ô∏è Proxmox VE Home Lab ‚Äî Virtualization & System Administration
Hardware: ZimaBlade | 1TB SSD | DDR3L RAM

üìå Overview
This project documents my process of building a self-hosted virtualization lab using Proxmox VE on a ZimaBlade server. The goal was to create an environment for running multiple virtual machines (VMs) and containers, hosting services, and practicing system administration and security.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware & Software Used
ZimaBlade mini-server

1TB SSD

DDR3L SO-DIMM RAM

Proxmox VE (latest stable release)

Client machine for management (Windows/Linux/Mac)

üöÄ Step-by-Step Implementation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Preparation
Installed 1TB SSD and DDR3L RAM into ZimaBlade.

Connected power, Ethernet, keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Proxmox VE
Downloaded Proxmox VE ISO from official site.

Flashed the ISO to a USB drive using Rufus.

Booted ZimaBlade from USB and installed Proxmox VE on the SSD.

Set root password, hostname, timezone, and network settings.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Accessing the Web Interface
Logged into https://<server-ip>:8006 from a browser.

Credentials:
User: root
Password: <set during install>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating VMs & Containers
Uploaded OS ISOs (Ubuntu Server, Debian, Kali Linux) to Proxmox storage.

Created VMs with allocated CPU, RAM, and disk space.

Created LXC containers for lightweight services.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying Services
Docker + Portainer ‚Üí App deployment & management.

Pi-hole ‚Üí Network-wide ad blocker.

File Server (Nextcloud/Samba) ‚Üí Shared storage.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Backup & Snapshot Management
Created snapshots before major changes.

Configured scheduled backups to local storage and external drives.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Security Hardening
Enabled 2FA for Proxmox login.

Configured firewall rules to limit access.

Set up SSH key authentication.

üí° Lab Ideas
SOC environment with Security Onion.

Honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea) for threat analysis.

VLAN & network segmentation experiments.

ELK stack for log aggregation and monitoring.

üìÇ Project Status
In Progress ‚Äî Actively deploying new services and experimenting with security setups.
