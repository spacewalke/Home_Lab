# üñ•Ô∏è Proxmox VE Home Lab ‚Äî Virtualization & System Administration  
**Hardware:** ZimaBlade | 1TB SSD | DDR3L RAM  

## üìå Overview  
This project documents my process of building a **self-hosted virtualization lab** using **Proxmox VE** on a ZimaBlade server.  
The goal was to create an environment for running multiple virtual machines (VMs) and containers, hosting services, and practicing system administration and security.

üñ•Ô∏è Proxmox VE Home Lab ‚Äî Virtualization & System Administration
Hardware: ZimaBlade ‚Ä¢ 1TB SSD ‚Ä¢ DDR3L RAM

üìå Project Overview
I‚Äôve been building a self-hosted virtualization lab on a ZimaBlade mini-server using Proxmox VE.
The aim is to have a compact, efficient platform for running multiple VMs and containers, experimenting with services, and honing my sysadmin and security skills‚Äîall within my own network.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware & Software
ZimaBlade Mini-Server

1TB SSD (primary storage)

DDR3L SO-DIMM RAM

Proxmox VE (latest stable release)

Client device for management (Windows, Linux, or macOS)

üöÄ Step-by-Step Build
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Setup
Installed the 1TB SSD and DDR3L RAM into the ZimaBlade

Hooked up power, Ethernet, keyboard, mouse, and monitor

2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Proxmox VE
Downloaded the latest Proxmox VE ISO from the official site

Flashed the ISO to a USB stick (Rufus on Windows / Balena Etcher on Mac/Linux)

Booted from USB and installed Proxmox VE to the SSD

Set root password, hostname, timezone, and network config

3Ô∏è‚É£ Web Interface Access
Opened https://<server-ip>:8006 in a browser

Logged in with root credentials set during installation

4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Virtual Machines & Containers
Uploaded OS ISOs (Ubuntu Server, Debian, Kali Linux) to Proxmox storage

Created VMs with dedicated CPU, RAM, and disk allocations

Spun up LXC containers for lightweight, service-based workloads

5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying Services
Docker + Portainer ‚Üí Simplified app deployment & management

Pi-hole ‚Üí Network-wide ad blocking

Nextcloud / Samba ‚Üí File server for personal and shared storage

6Ô∏è‚É£ Backup & Snapshot Management
Took snapshots before making major changes

Scheduled automated backups to both local storage and external drives

7Ô∏è‚É£ Security Hardening
Enabled 2FA for Proxmox login

Configured firewall rules to limit access

Set up SSH key authentication for secure remote management

üí° Future Lab Experiments
SOC environment with Security Onion

Honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea) for hands-on threat analysis

VLAN & network segmentation testing

ELK stack for log collection, aggregation, and monitoring

üìÇ Current Status
In Progress ‚Äî New services are being deployed, and security experiments are ongoing.
The goal is to make this lab a sandbox for everything from virtualization experiments to incident response practice.
